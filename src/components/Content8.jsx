            Premature ejaculation occurs when a man ejaculates before or
            immediately after penetration. Causes include psychological issues
            such as performance anxiety, stressors, sexual inhibitions or
            physical issues such as nerve or spinal cord damage, or some
            medications.
            <br />
            Inhibited ejaculation, on the other hand, is when you canâ€™t
            ejaculate. Some men, particularly those with diabetic neuropathy,
            experience 'retrograde ejaculation', which means that when they
            climax, ejaculation enters the bladder instead of exiting through
            the penis.
